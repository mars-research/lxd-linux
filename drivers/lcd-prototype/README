Introduction
------------

This is a simple prototype (with a small test) for the LCD architecture. It
consists of:

  [ 1 ] an API module (in api dir) that implements a simplified capability
        subsystem and ipc subsystem

  [ 2 ] a `library' module (in liblcd dir) that is intended to contain
        high-level routines that lcd's can call directly into that carry
        out low-level tasks (for now, it just contains a simple implementation
        of a data store, more below).

  [ 3 ] a group of 4 test modules (in test dir)
