 * Operations an LCD can invoke on its own cspace.

 * Why do we have this header if we have libcap? Because an LCD
 * cannot do e.g. cap_insert on its own cspace. It does operations
 * on its own cspace via hypercalls out into the microkernel. Similar
 * for kLCDs. That's what these functions are for.
