 * RAM MAPPING --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * RAM mapping area is 1 GB (2^18 pages).

 * The minimum address space block you can allocate from the RAM map
 * area is 2 MBs (2^9 = 512 pages). This leads to a lot of internal
 * fragmentation, but this is tolerable, so long as we don't need to
 * map RAM more than 200 or so times. (The actual memory object will
 * likely be considerably smaller than 2 MBs, so only the first
 * few KBs may actually be backed/mapped in guest physical. But the
 * entire 2 MB region will be considered occupied by the internal
 * RAM map allocator.)
 *
 * The maximum address space block you can allocate from the RAM map
 * area is 256 MB (2^16 = 65,536 pages).
 *
 * In hindsight, maybe a simple bitmap would have been just as good
 * here since there are only 1GB/64MB = 512 allocation blocks. Oh well. (These
 * mapping regions were originally gonna be a lot bigger, but I had
 * to switch over to 2MB guest virtual pages instead of 1GB pages. Etc.
 * etc.)
