/* COMPILER: On the *caller* side, before any functions in the vfs interface
 * are invoked, the module must invoke glue_vfs_init. (In general, it is
 * glue_<module_name>_init). glue_vfs_init is defined here. Since
 * the vfs module takes one argument (vfs_chnl), glue_vfs_init takes
 * a capability to vfs_chnl as an argument, and initializes the static
 * global below.
 *
 * COMPILER: Furthermore, glue_vfs_init initializes a data store
 * for storing objects and corresponding references that the callee (vfs
 * in this example) will use to refer to those objects.
 *
 * COMPILER: For now, assume that there is one glue cspace for
 * every channel argument.
 *
 * NOTE: We have to use globals since C functions in the original interface
 * are not modified to take extra arguments (like a capability to the ipc
 * channel). We do not use the trampoline trick (as we do for function

/* CONTAINER STRUCTS -------------------------------------------------- */

/* COMPILER: For *every* struct type used in a projection, we generate
 * a container struct definition that has the following fields:
 *   -- the original struct
 *   -- two cptr_t fields: one for the remote reference the caller will
 *      use to refer to the callee's private copy, and one for the reference 
 *      the callee uses to refer to the caller's private copy
 *   -- any arguments to the projection (right now, these fields will
 *      always be cptr_t's to ipc channels)
 *   -- any fields ever allocated in any use of the projection (right now,
 *      these fields will always be cptr_t's to ipc channels)
 *
 * In this example, there are 3 struct types: struct fs, 
 * struct fs_operations, and struct file. One of the projections for 
 * struct fs allocates a channel and stores it in the chnl field, so we
 * add "chnl" to the fields for the container struct for struct fs. 
 *
 * One of the projections for struct fs_operations takes an argument named
 * "chnl", so we add that field to the conatiner struct. NOTE: We wrap
 * the cptr inside a struct ipc_channel, since this is the data structure
 * required for interfacing with the dispatch loop.
