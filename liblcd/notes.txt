todo:

-- set up liblcd build
-- try linking with mm test module
-- try running

=====


Need:

virt_to_head_page
virt_to_page
alloc_pages_exact_node, in slab.c:kmem_getpages
page_address
free_memcg_kmem_pages (as free pages)

see in : slab_map_pages

====

strategy:

-- statically allocate page structs
-- bring in page struct def? probably not
-- bring in page flags header? probably not - should just work
-- to implement alloc pages -
   -- loop through free mem pages bitmap
   -- find chunk of right size
   -- set up page structs
-- can we free part of a chunk? hopefully not

-- virt to page -- 
   -- page align the address, then look it up in array of page structs,
      make sure it's in range
-- virt to head page - translate virt address to page
